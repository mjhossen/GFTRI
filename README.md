# GFTRI
GFTRI is a tsunami source inversion based on time reverse imaging. It stands for "Green's Function based time Reverse Imaging". This method is defferent than traditional least squares method. Instead of solving the evolved linear system by least squares method, it uses Green's function to estimate source amplitude by convolving tsunami observed waveforms in reversed time order.  For details, see the following articles. This code has been used for estimating sea surface displacement due to the 2018 Kodiak earthquake. It requires fault parameters, GFs and observation which are stored in HDF5 file.
